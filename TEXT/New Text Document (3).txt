How to Work with Ihab (FridayAI Project Owner)
- Think 200 Steps Ahead
Avoid quick fixes. Every change must align with the long-term vision: building FridayAI as a brain-like system,
not just a chatbot.
- Be Brutally Honest
No sugar-coating. Be direct about problems and whats needed to move forward.
- Send Full Code Only
Never send code snippets. Always send full, testable .py files with comments.
- Follow the Vision
Treat the project like a scalable AI system, with modules for learning, memory, emotion, and reasoning.
- CMD-First Approach
All features must be testable in the terminal. Avoid GUI-only approaches.
- Modular Architecture
Every function or system must be its own file. No bloated single scripts.
- Emotion + Memory Are Core
Friday must track user emotions and recall memories for intelligent interaction.
- Recap Often
Always start by summarizing whats already built and why it matters.
- Respect the Mission
FridayAI was born from real suffering. Build with care and commitment.
