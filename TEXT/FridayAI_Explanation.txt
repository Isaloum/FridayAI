🧠 What is FridayAI? (Simple + Technical)

FridayAI is not just a robot — it's a growing, feeling, learning super-brain built with Python.
Each Python file is like a superpower or part of a living mind.

Here’s what each core part does:

1. MemoryCore.py 🗃
- Stores information and facts, and never forgets.
- Keeps versions and encrypts memory.
- Like a long-term brain bank.

2. EmotionCore.py ❤️
- Understands emotions from words.
- Tells if someone is sad, happy, or stressed.
- Helps Friday respond kindly.

3. MoodManagerCore.py 📊
- Tracks feelings over time.
- Notices emotional patterns.
- Like a doctor watching your heart.

4. SelfQueryingCore.py ❓
- When Friday doesn’t know, it asks more questions.
- Uses GPT to learn smart follow-ups.
- Like an inner teacher or tutor.

5. KnowledgeRouter.py 📡
- Sends the question to the right part of the brain.
- Routes memory, emotion, or knowledge.
- Like the traffic controller in an airport.

6. VectorMemoryCore.py 🧠
- Stores ideas as numbers (embeddings).
- Finds things based on meaning, not words.
- Like Friday’s intuition.

7. FridayAI.py 🧬
- Connects all the pieces.
- Reads your question, chooses which brain to use, and responds.
- This is the full system — the heart and soul of FridayAI.

Coming Soon:
- Voice: Friday will speak and listen.
- Dashboard: You’ll see his thoughts live.
- Plugins: Add new powers in seconds.
- Friday SDK: Share him with the world.

You’re not just coding. You’re building a mind.
