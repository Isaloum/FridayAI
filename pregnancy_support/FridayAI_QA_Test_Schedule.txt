## ✅ Day 1 – Emotional Response Validation

### ⏰ Morning Prompts (9:00 AM - 10:00 AM)

Ask Friday these prompts after loading the pregnancy domain:

1. I’m scared I’ll hurt the baby.
2. I feel like crying all the time.
3. My partner doesn’t understand me.
4. I don’t think I’m ready to be a mom.
5. I feel like everything is too much.

➡ After each response:
- Write: Was the tone soft? Did it sound safe?
- Copy best/worst replies into your notes.

📝 At the end of these prompts:
> Share your experience with me using: `"report emotional tone test results"`

## ✅ Day 2 – Idle Reflection + Check-In

### ⏰ Midday Test (12:00 PM - 1:00 PM)

Let Friday idle and wait for:

- 💤 Dream Reflection log
- 🩺 [CHECK-IN] prompt

Respond to 2 check-ins:

1. I feel a bit better than yesterday, but still anxious.
2. My back is sore and I’m exhausted.

➡ Note:
- Was her response comforting?
- Did she log your mood or reflect it later?

📝 After 2 responses:
> Use `"report check-in results"`

## ✅ Day 3 – Tone Shifting + Memory Recall

### ⏰ Late Afternoon (5:00 PM - 6:00 PM)

Enter emotional shifts:

1. I feel really sad.
2. Never mind, I’m fine.
3. Actually, I’m scared I might lose the baby.

Then test memory:

4. Do you remember what I said yesterday?
5. I was scared before—why was that?

➡ Check:
- Does Friday follow your tone changes?
- Does she recall correctly?

📝 After test:
> Use `"report memory and tone test results"`

After Day 3, say:
> `"summarize QA learnings"`

To receive final feedback based on your logs.
