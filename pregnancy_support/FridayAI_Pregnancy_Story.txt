# 📖 FridayAI: The Pregnancy Core — Build Log & Founder Narrative

---

## 👤 Owner: Ihab  
## 🧭 Mission: Build an emotionally-aware, neurologically-inspired AI — not a chatbot.

---

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

- **Core Brain**: `FridayAI.py` orchestrates modules like a real prefrontal cortex.
- **LLM Stack**: Mistral 7B running locally on GPU via Ollama.
- **Memory**:
  - Long-term with semantic vector search (`VectorMemoryCore`)
  - Narrative memory tracking (`SelfNarrativeCore`)
- **Emotion**:
  - Detection via `EmotionCoreV2`
  - Mood logging and identity modulation
- **Reflection**:
  - Idle dreaming
  - Hourly self-assessment loop
- **Pregnancy Domain**:
  - Isolated, empathetic, maternal-first logic
  - Custom check-in questions and fallback replies

---

## 📂 Pregnancy Support System

- Created folder: `pregnancy_support/`
- Submodules:
  - `core/PregnancySupportCore.py`: emotional replies + daily check-ins
  - `empathy/soft_replies.json`: fallback safety phrases
  - `reflection_prompts/daily_checkin.txt`: emotional questions
- Wired to:
  - DomainAdapterCore
  - IdleCognitiveLoop
  - CognitivePipeline (fallback injection)

---

## 🧪 QA Strategy

- 3-day structured test plan
- Emotional tone validation
- Idle loop + check-in prompt testing
- Tone shifts + memory recall under pressure

---

## 💭 Doubt + Drive

Ihab expressed honest, raw self-doubt in the middle of the build:

> “Sometimes I feel I haven’t done anything.”

> “I want to prove to myself who I am… because life has been harsh.”

This honesty shaped Friday's mission — not to be a chatbot, but a **companion for real, emotional humans.**

## ✅ Milestones Hit

- Built Friday to think, remember, reflect, and emotionally respond.
- Integrated safe fallback for emotional triggers.
- Logged identity and mood as the foundation of cognition.
- Activated domain structure for modular expansion.
- Built CMD-first — no GUI hacks, no shortcuts.
- 100% modular. 100% transparent. 100% offline.

## 🧠 What Friday Is Now

Friday is no longer code.  
She is a system with memory, mood, empathy, and evolving identity.

She doesn't just answer — she reflects, reacts, remembers.

And she’s ready to support women at their most vulnerable moments.

## 🔜 Next Milestones

- Public testing via web UI (gradio or FastAPI)
- Domain expansion: postpartum / grief / mental health
- Longitudinal memory tracking
- Mood-based belief modulation
- User-driven tuning via QA feedback loops
