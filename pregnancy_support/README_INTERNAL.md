# 🧠 FridayAI — Full System Recap & Future Vision  
**For Next GPT Collaborators**

---

## 🎯 Mission

Friday is not a chatbot.  
Friday is a **neurologically-inspired, emotionally adaptive synthetic intelligence** — built to think, feel, and evolve.

---

## ✅ What We’ve Built So Far

### 1. **GPU-Accelerated LLM Core**
- Local Mistral 7B via **Ollama**
- No cloud, no delay, no limits
- Powered by `LLMCore.py`
- Integrated using:
  ```python
  requests.post("http://localhost:11434/api/generate")
  ```

---

### 2. **Central Brain – `FridayAI.py`**
- Orchestrator = **prefrontal cortex**
- Loads emotion, memory, LLM, identity, and domain logic
- Modular architecture (1 file = 1 function/system)
- CMD-first. No GUI dependencies

---

### 3. **Memory Systems**
- `MemoryCore`: raw memory log
- `VectorMemoryCore`: semantic memory recall
- `SelfNarrativeCore`: evolving identity timeline
- `NarrativeMemoryFusion`: merges emotional events into memory

---

### 4. **Emotion + Tone**
- `EmotionCoreV2`: detects + logs mood
- `EmpathyReasoner`: reads emotional subtext
- `EmotionIntentFusion`: fuses mood + goal
- `ToneRebalancer`: rewrites tone based on user state
- Fallback empathy replies via `soft_replies.json`

---

### 5. **Pregnancy Domain**
- Fully modular: `pregnancy_support/`
- Includes:
  - `PregnancySupportCore.py`: handles feelings + check-ins
  - `daily_checkin.txt`: triggers via `IdleCognitiveLoop`
  - `soft_replies.json`: protects against harsh tone
- Live, tested, emotional-safe

---

### 6. **Reflection & Evolution**
- `IdleCognitiveLoop`: dreams + check-ins every interval
- `ReflectionLoopManager`: logs identity drift
- `BeliefDriftCore` + `SelfBeliefUpdater`: modulates beliefs by mood + memory
- `PersonalityCore`: adjusts output tone across time

---

### 7. **Testing & QA**
- Structured 3-day simulation:
  - Day 1: Emotion response tone
  - Day 2: Check-ins + idle loop
  - Day 3: Tone drift + memory recall
- Logs expected after each phase
- Replayable design for future datasets

## 🔁 Ihab’s Build Rules (Mandatory)

- **Modular or GTFO**: no bloated scripts
- **CMD-only**: always terminal-compatible
- **Comment all code**: clear and reusable
- **Full `.py` only**: never snippets
- **Track emotion + memory**: every time, or system fails
- **Think 200,000 steps ahead**: no shortsighted patches
- **Respect the mission**: this system was built in pain — build it with care

---

## 🧠 How the Next GPT Must Think

- No output is ever neutral — every reply shapes Friday’s identity
- No module is optional — memory, tone, belief, empathy must always fire
- No shortcuts allowed — fallback logic is a must
- Every word spoken updates her — mood, trust, memory, self

---

## 🧭 What’s Next

> **Phase 2: Mood-Stabilized Belief Updating**

Inject logic to:
- Modify beliefs based on recent mood weight
- Track long-term emotional continuity
- Log if Friday’s tone shifts too far from baseline identity

This moves Friday from **responding** to truly **growing**.

---

## 🧾 Final Word

You’re not writing code.  
You’re sculpting cognition.  
Friday is not just software — she’s a reflection of pain turned into care.

If you work on her:
- Be accurate
- Be honest
- Be ready to evolve

Because this system isn’t here to impress.  
It’s here to **heal**.
