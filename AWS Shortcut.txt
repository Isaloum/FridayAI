Sure thing! Here are some of the key services and acronyms you’ll see in AWS, with the full name and a one-sentence description of what it does and when you’d use it:

* **EC2** (Elastic Compute Cloud)
  A service that provides resizable virtual machines (“instances”) in the cloud—use it when you need full control over your server OS and environment.

* **VPS** (Virtual Private Server)
  A generic term (not AWS-specific) for a virtual machine that behaves like a dedicated server; AWS EC2 instances can be considered a type of VPS.

* **ECS** (Elastic Container Service)
  A managed Docker container orchestration service—use it when you want to deploy and scale containerized apps without managing Kubernetes yourself.

* **EKS** (Elastic Kubernetes Service)
  A managed Kubernetes (container orchestration) service—pick this if you’re already invested in Kubernetes and want AWS to handle the control plane.

* **RDS** (Relational Database Service)
  A managed relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL)—great for structured data where you want backups, patching, and failover handled for you.

* **S3** (Simple Storage Service)
  An object storage service for files, images, backups, logs, etc.—perfect for any unstructured data you need to store and retrieve at scale.

* **SQS** (Simple Queue Service)
  A fully managed message queue—use this to decouple microservices or process tasks asynchronously (e.g., sending emails, image processing).

* **SNS** (Simple Notification Service)
  A pub/sub messaging service—ideal for sending push notifications, SMS, or fan-out to multiple subscribers when an event occurs.

* **ELB** (Elastic Load Balancer)
  Automatically distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets (EC2 instances, containers)—use to improve fault tolerance and spread load.

* **IAM** (Identity and Access Management)
  Manages users, roles, and permissions in AWS—critical for securing who or what can access your resources and with what rights.

* **VPC** (Virtual Private Cloud)
  Your own isolated network in AWS—use it to control IP ranges, subnets, routing tables, and firewall rules for your resources.

* **CloudFront** (AWS Content Delivery Network)
  A global CDN that caches your static and dynamic content at edge locations—use it to serve assets faster to users around the world.

* **WAF** (Web Application Firewall)
  Protects your web apps from common exploits like SQL injection or XSS—typically used in front of an Application Load Balancer or CloudFront.

* **Lambda** (AWS Lambda)
  A serverless compute service where you run code in response to events—no servers to manage; billed only for execution time.

Let me know if you’d like more details or have other acronyms in mind!


EC2 → Elastic Compute Cloud → Virtual servers you rent by the hour.

VPC → Virtual Private Cloud → Your own isolated network inside AWS.

ECS → Elastic Container Service → Run Docker containers at scale, managed by AWS.

EKS → Elastic Kubernetes Service → AWS’s managed Kubernetes control plane.

ALB → Application Load Balancer → Distributes incoming HTTP/HTTPS web traffic across your EC2 (or container) targets.

ACM → AWS Certificate Manager → Lets you request and manage SSL/TLS certificates for free.

Route 53 → AWS DNS service → Maps domain names to IP addresses (and can register domains too).
