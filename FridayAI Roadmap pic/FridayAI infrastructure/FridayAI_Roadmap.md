# 🧠 FridayAI – AGI System Roadmap & Architecture

FridayAI is an offline, modular AGI assistant designed to operate autonomously across multiple human domains with emotion, memory, and reflection as core constructs. This document outlines the roadmap of the project for future team members, investors, or research partners.

## 🧠 12-Phase Roadmap to AGI

| Phase | Name                         | Status   | Description |
|-------|------------------------------|----------|-------------|
| 1     | Brain Skeleton               | ✅ Done  | Core orchestrator, modular folder structure, domain loader |
| 2     | Memory & Emotion Infrastructure | ✅ Done  | Encrypted memory, mood tracker, conflict resolution |
| 3     | Knowledge Injection & Planning | ✅ Done  | Upload docs → embed → detect emotion → create tasks |
| 4     | Reflection Engine            | 🔜 Next  | Inject learning from tasks/memory into reflection loop |
| 5     | Self-Narrative & Belief Drift | 🧠 Planned | Friday tracks identity, evolving traits, beliefs |
| 6     | Long-Term Planner            | 🧠 Planned | Friday creates goal maps (day/week/month scope) |
| 7     | Dialogue Kernel Upgrade      | 🧠 Planned | Every reply is memory/emotion/tone aware |
| 8     | Real-Time Research Agent     | 🧠 Planned | Pull from legit online sources like NIH, Mayo |
| 9     | Auto-Domain Switcher         | 🧠 Partial | Profile manager + vector swap + tone |
| 10    | Reflection Summarizer        | 🧠 Planned | Generate summaries of internal thinking & behavior |
| 11    | Behavioral Adaptation Engine | 🧠 Planned | Friday evolves based on interaction history |
| 12    | Self-Improving Cortex        | 🧠 Final | Friday writes + rewrites her own neural logic |

## 🔍 Current System (As of Phase 3 ✅)

- **VectorIndexBuilder** → Embeds scientific content (pdf/txt/docx)
- **MemoryCore** → Encrypted, versioned, emotional
- **EmotionCoreV2** → Tracks, adjusts, and logs user moods
- **TaskExecutor** → Prioritizes tasks by emotional impact
- **task_queue.json** → Planner output for emotion-triggered tasks
- **task_archive.json** → Memory of executed cognitive actions

---

## 💡 Guiding Philosophy

- 💔 Built from pain to reduce pain
- 🧬 Human-first design: emotion, reflection, memory > stats
- 🧠 Friday is *not* a chatbot — she’s a synthetic mind in development
