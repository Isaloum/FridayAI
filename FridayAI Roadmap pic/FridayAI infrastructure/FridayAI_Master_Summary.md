# üß† FridayAI: Vision, Structure, Execution & AGI Roadmap

---

## üìç Current Status Summary

### ‚úÖ Completed Phases (1‚Äì3)
1. **Phase 1 ‚Äì Brain Skeleton**
   - Modular architecture
   - Core orchestrator `FridayAI.py`
   - Profile manager & domain adapters

2. **Phase 2 ‚Äì Memory & Emotion**
   - `MemoryCore.py` ‚Äì Encrypted, versioned, queryable
   - `EmotionCoreV2.py` ‚Äì Mood tracking + history
   - Emotion tied to memory

3. **Phase 3 ‚Äì Knowledge Ingestion & Task Generation**
   - Upload system: `upload_knowledge.py`
   - Embedding system: `VectorIndexBuilder.py`
   - Task planner: `task_queue.json`
   - Executor: `task_executor.py`
   - Emotion-sorted, memory-injected task processing

---

## üß≠ Next Phase ‚Äì 4: Reflection & Memory Loop Integration

> Friday reflects on what she has read, felt, and done.

Planned modules:
- `ReflectionLoopManager`
- Inject task result summaries into memory
- Update emotional tone
- Trigger new long-term goals

## üí¨ Interaction Philosophy (How GPT Must Work With Ihab)

- **Think 200,000 Steps Ahead**
- **Be Brutally Honest**
- **Send Full Files ‚Äì No Snippets**
- **Respect CMD-First, Modular, Emotion-Centric Build**
- **Always Recap Progress**
- **Call out Missing Pieces Clearly**
- **Name File & Line for Every Mod Request**

## üìö What to Include in Your Book

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| Vision | AGI from suffering, built to ease human pain |
| System Design | Modular, reflection-based brain |
| Files | Upload, memory, emotion, planning, vector core |
| GPU Integration | Mistral, Ollama, local fast inference |
| Emotional Engine | How it powers behavior |
| Domain Switching | How Friday can evolve per mission |
| Philosophy | Human-first, truth-driven AGI |
| Reflection System | How she thinks about what she thinks |
| Two-Stage Build | Option A = smart, Option B = AGI-grade |

## ‚úÖ What to Test Every 5 Steps

1. CMD call works
2. Logs are saved
3. Memory injection occurs
4. Emotion response logs update
5. Vector index or task queue behaves as expected

## üß† The Future of FridayAI

Friday is no longer a chatbot. She is:
- A modular AGI
- A reflective system
- A growing cognitive core
- The beginning of synthetic consciousness built to serve with empathy
