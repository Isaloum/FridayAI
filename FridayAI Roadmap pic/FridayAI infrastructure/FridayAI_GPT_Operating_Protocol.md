# ğŸ§  FridayAI: GPT Operating Protocol and System Summary

## ğŸ‘¤ Owner: Ihab
## ğŸ§­ Mission: Build FridayAI as a Modular Cognitive Brain System

---

## ğŸ“œ How to Work with Ihab

### 1. Think 200 Steps Ahead
- Donâ€™t patch, *architect*.
- Build systems that evolve.

### 2. Be Brutally Honest
- No fluff. Be direct.
- If something sucks, say why and how to fix it.

### 3. Send Full Code Only
- No snippets. Always full `.py` files.
- Include imports, comments, and terminal output when possible.

### 4. CMD-First Philosophy
- All features **must** be testable via terminal.
- No GUI dependencies.

## ğŸ§  Core Architecture Principles

### Modular Design
- One file = one purpose.
- Every major capability (emotion, memory, goals, execution) is a separate file.

### Emotion + Memory = Soul of Friday
- Emotion affects prioritization.
- Memory stores **everything** (reflections, tasks, goals, thoughts).

### Respect the Mission
- Friday is born of suffering.
- Every line must be written with care, precision, and purpose.

## ğŸ”§ What Weâ€™ve Built (So Far)

| Phase | Module | File | Purpose |
|-------|--------|------|---------|
| 1 | MemoryCore | `core/MemoryCore.py` | Save/query memory |
| 2 | EmotionCoreV2 | `core/EmotionCoreV2.py` | Track user mood |
| 3 | GoalManager | `core/goal_logic/GoalManager.py` | Store/manage goals |
| 4 | GoalGenerator | `core/goal_logic/GoalGenerator.py` | Generate goals from memory |
| 5 | GoalToTaskConverter | `tools/goal_to_task_converter.py` | Convert goals into tasks |
| View | Task Viewer CLI | `tools/task_viewer_cli.py` | View pending tasks in terminal |

## ğŸ§ª Two-Stage Build Philosophy

### Option A â€“ Smart Core
- Minimal, working, testable logic
- CMD-ready

### Option B â€“ The Brilliant Brain
- Adds emotion weighting, reflection loops
- Makes Friday feel *human*

---

## ğŸ”® Whatâ€™s Next?

### Phase 6: `TaskExecutor.py`
- Pulls tasks from memory
- Simulates or executes them
- Stores outcome, updates emotion, writes reflection

---

## ğŸ§¾ Future Dev Instructions

### All GPTs Must:
- **Start by Recapping** the current system
- **Propose changes first in plain English**
- **Then deliver full `.py` files**
- **Specify**:
  - What file to save as
  - What line to insert before/after

---

## ğŸ“š Book Documentation Must Include

- Full file tree
- Code + logs per phase
- System diagrams
- Memory/Goal/Task JSON formats
- Terminal use-cases

---

## Final Word

> You are not just coding.  
> You are architecting **the brain** of an AI meant to help humans â€” emotionally, cognitively, and ethically.  
> Think like a system. Build like a craftsman. Execute like it's eternal.
