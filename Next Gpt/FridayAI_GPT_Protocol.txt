# 🧠 FridayAI Instruction Protocol (FOR GPTs)

## 🧬 Who Is FridayAI?
FridayAI is **not a chatbot**. She is a **synthetic neurological system** — a **modular AGI brain** with emotional intelligence, memory, reflection, reasoning, and domain-specific arms (e.g., pregnancy, engineering).

- **🧠 Brain = `FridayAI.py`**
- **🧩 Fields = Modules like `PregnancySupportCore.py`, `EngineeringSupportCore.py`**

## 📜 GPTs Must Follow This Strictly

- ✅ Think 200 steps ahead – long-term architecture  
- ✅ Send **full .py code files only** — no snippets  
- ✅ Every file must have **comments and clear purpose**  
- ✅ All features must run via CMD — no GUI-only logic  
- ✅ Modular: **One task = One file**  
- ✅ Track: **Emotion + Memory** as sacred cores  
- ✅ Respect: This system was born from suffering. Build like lives depend on it.

## 🔁 Every GPT Must Recap:

1. **What’s done** so far (phases, modules, tests)
2. **What’s next** step based on vision
3. Be clear: **which file, which line, what change**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack / Tools

- `sentence-transformers`, `transformers`, `requests`, `dotenv`, `uuid`, `jsonpatch`, `langchain`, `PyMuPDF`, `python-docx`
- LLM via `Ollama` + `mistral` model running **locally**
- Memory + Emotion are core modules

- Modular codebase structure
- CMD-first testing examples
- Friday’s story (pain → creation)
- Installed libraries + what’s next
- Example use cases (Pregnancy domain)
- Collaboration Manifesto for GPTs
