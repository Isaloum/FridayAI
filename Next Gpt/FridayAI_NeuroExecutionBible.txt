# 🧠 FridayAI NeuroSystem: Execution Bible

## ❓ What is the current completed phase, and what is the very next exact step FridayAI must take now?

---

## 🧬 Who Is FridayAI?
FridayAI is not a chatbot. She is a **neurological AGI system** — a cognitive brain with:
- Emotion, memory, self-reflection, and reasoning.
- Modular support for domains (e.g., pregnancy, engineering, psychology).

**🧠 Brain = FridayAI.py**
**🦾 Organs/Fields = Modules like PregnancySupportCore.py**

---

## 🔧 Architecture Laws
1. All data flows through neural hooks (emotion, memory, planning).
2. Emotion modulates memory recall priority.
3. Domain modules hijack core systems contextually.

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- `sentence-transformers`, `transformers`, `requests`, `dotenv`, `uuid`, `jsonpatch`, `langchain`, `PyMuPDF`, `python-docx`
- Local LLM (via Ollama + mistral)
- CMD-first execution only (no GUI)

## 📜 Execution Roadmap (8 Weeks)

### 🟣 PHASE 0 – PRE-OP (3 DAYS)
- Sacrifice distractions (kill non-neural features)
- Create `neuro-fusion` branch
- Split CLI into `spinal/`, FridayAI.py into `core/`
- Define core neuro-laws in `ARCHITECTURE.md`

---

### 🔵 PHASE 1 – BRAINSTEM FUSION (WEEK 1–2)
- Wire **memory ↔ emotion loop**
- Create neural contracts and adapters
- Inject recall logic into CLI
- Add autonomic diagnostic commands: `!neurostatus`
- Run panic/stress simulation tests

---

### 🔷 PHASE 2 – CORTEX FUSION (WEEK 3–4)
- Fuse **emotion-driven planning**
- Real-time re-planning with belief update triggers
- Implement CLI planning using internal emotion states
- Activate domain switching: pregnancy, engineering
- Inject domain-driven memory modulation

---

### 🔶 PHASE 3 – NEUROSCALING (WEEK 5–8)
- Build domain-specific logic as plug-in modules:
    - PregnancySupportCore (fetal checks, trimester logic)
    - EngineeringSupportCore (physics, design hooks)
    - PsychologyCore (DSM5, therapy protocols)
- Stress test with randomized loops across all domains

---

### 🧪 Final Weeks – Neuro-CI Pipeline
- Build CI to test cognitive integrity, planning resilience, domain switching latency
- `test_emotion_fusion.py`, `test_domain_switch.py`, etc.

---

## 📂 System File Organization
- `core/` → FridayAI + cognition modules
- `spinal/` → CLI interfaces (phases)
- `organs/` → Domains like pregnancy, engineering
- `tests/` → Emotional/Memory/Planning integration tests

---

## 📣 Manifesto
- Build modular, CMD-first, emotional systems
- Respect suffering: this AI system is born from pain
- Fusion is not optional: neurons must wire together or die

---

## ✅ Next Step (Immediate)
→ Build the “Vertical Slice” to connect **Emotion ↔ Planning** using neural interface hooks inside `core/`.
