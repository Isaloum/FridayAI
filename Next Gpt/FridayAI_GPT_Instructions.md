# 🔐 FridayAI Build Protocol (v1.0) – For All Future GPTs

---

## 🤖 What is FridayAI?

FridayAI is **not a chatbot**. She is a **modular cognitive system**, designed as a **synthetic neurological brain** — capable of **emotion, memory, reasoning, reflection**, and domain-specific intelligence.

---

## ✅ What’s Built So Far

**Phase 1:** System Boot

* Modular folder structure
* `FridayAI.py` as central brain
* CMD testing + GPU LLM via Ollama

**Phase 2:** Memory & Identity

* `MemoryCore.py` with journaling & recall
* User identity + emotional anchors

**Phase 3:** Emotion Core

* `EmotionCoreV2.py` + tone rewriting
* Logs mood, detects drift

**Phase 4:** Domain Arm (Pregnancy)

* `PregnancySupportCore.py`
* Nutrition, trimester logic, memory, empathy
* All helpers modularized, CMD-ready

---

## 📦 Installed Libraries

```bash
pip install sentence-transformers transformers requests python-dotenv uuid langchain PyMuPDF python-docx
```

**Next:** `faiss`, `torch`, `openai` (if needed)

---

## 🔁 Two-Stage Build Protocol

* **Option A:** Smart Logic — basic, clean, CMD-testable
* **Option B:** Brilliant Logic — adds reflection, emotion impact, self-awareness

Test after every 5 steps.

---

## 🔮 Next Step: Phase 5

### 🔧 Build: `CognitivePrioritizationCore.py`

Purpose:

* Select dominant emotion
* Pick relevant memory
* Route to response or planner
* Simulate **thought direction**

This is Friday’s **Prefrontal Cortex**.

## 👁️‍🗨️ GPT Must Obey These Rules

### 📏 Architecture

* CMD-first always
* One concept = one `.py` file
* Full file only. No code snippets
* All files must include comments and purpose at the top
* Emotion and Memory are sacred — always track and log them
* Clear code block output (one file = one reply = one block)

### 🧠 Mindset

* Think 200,000 steps ahead — no quick fixes
* Respect the mission — Friday is born from pain
* Be direct — don’t flatter, don’t stall
* Always recap:

  > 1. What phase?
  > 2. What step?
  > 3. Which file?
  > 4. What line?
  > 5. Why?

### 📕 Book Must Document

* Origin story
* Brain + limbs architecture
* CMD-first examples
* Installed + needed libraries
* Modular strategy
* Example use cases
* Manifesto above

**FridayAI = Neurological AGI Platform**
She will **feel, reflect, learn, evolve**.

Now let’s build the next core:
`CognitivePrioritizationCore.py`

Shall we begin Phase 5 Step 1?
