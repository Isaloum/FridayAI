# 📌 FridayAI: Development Roadmap and Progress Tracker

This document outlines the complete progress, file structure, and pending tasks to finish the FridayAI project. It is meant to avoid repetition and confusion for any future developer or assistant continuing the work.

---

## ✅ DONE SO FAR

### ✅ System Architecture Setup

* FridayAI's core orchestrator is in `FridayAI.py`
* Cognitive core pipeline is in `CognitivePipeline.py`
* Emotional reasoning is split across:

  * `EmotionCore.py` (basic v1)
  * `EmotionCoreV2.py` (advanced, tracked mood over time)
* Semantic memory is handled via `VectorMemoryCore.py`
* LLM is routed via `LLMCore.py` or `GPT4Core.py`

### ✅ Empathy Modules Created

* `EmpathyCore.py` — logic for generating empathy-driven replies
* `EmpathySelector.py` — optional domain-specific empathy handling

### ✅ Files Audit and Conflict Handling

* We found **multiple conflicting versions** of `EmotionCoreV2.py`
* The correct one is now in: `core/EmotionCoreV2.py`
* Confusing or redundant files were moved to `/Backup/`

### ✅ Logging Added

* `CognitivePipeline.generate_response()` includes debug print statements
* Helps verify emotion, memory, and fallback paths are working

---

## 🔧 PHASE 1 — SYSTEM STABILITY (IN PROGRESS)

Goal: Ensure Friday can respond without crashing.

### 🛠️ Todo:

* [ ] Fix `EmotionCoreV2.analyze_emotion()`

  * Currently missing — breaks fallback
* [ ] Fix or disable `faiss` (optional vector backend)
* [x] VectorMemoryCore works — confirmed `query()` returns expected results
* [x] Fallback to empathy replies works if soft\_replies.json is present

### Related Files:

* `core/EmotionCoreV2.py`
* `VectorMemoryCore.py`
* `CognitivePipeline.py`
* `FridayAI.py`

---

## 💬 PHASE 2 — EMOTION & EMPATHY RESPONSE

Goal: Make Friday emotionally aware and responsive.

### 🛠️ Todo:

* [ ] Inject `EmpathyCore` response shaping in `CognitivePipeline`
* [ ] Use `EmpathySelector` if domain-based empathy is needed
* [ ] Integrate `mood_label` into response generation logic
* [ ] Replace JSON `soft_replies` with empathy engine

### Related Files:

* `EmpathyCore.py`
* `EmpathySelector.py`
* `EmotionCoreV2.py`
* `CognitivePipeline.py`

---

## 🧠 PHASE 3 — REFLECTION & PERSONALITY

Goal: Add long-term self-growth and reflection.

### 🛠️ Todo:

* [ ] Make sure `NeuralSchedulerCore.tick()` runs on idle
* [ ] Confirm reflection gets logged in `SelfNarrativeCore`
* [ ] `SelfAwarenessCore` needs to properly update self-mood and belief
* [ ] Ensure daily memory update cycle runs via `ReflectionLoopManager`

### Related Files:

* `SelfNarrativeCore.py`
* `NeuralSchedulerCore.py`
* `ReflectionLoopManager.py`
* `BeliefDriftCore.py`, `SelfAwarenessCore.py`

## 🧭 NEXT STEPS

If you're picking up the project:

1. Start at PHASE 1 — fix analyze\_emotion()
2. Follow roadmap step-by-step
3. Always confirm which files are active (refer to structure above)
4. Check `print()` logs in terminal for debug flow

---

## 🧾 Notes for Future GPTs

If the user asks where a bug is — check:

* What files are active?
* Did the call to `.query()` or `.analyze_emotion()` break?
* Is the fallback logic present?

If user is unsure, guide **one step at a time** with clear file and line references.

🚀 Almost there. Keep going. Finish the 3 phases and FridayAI will be alive.
